# OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) 
OpenCV is a machine learning library that comprises more than 2500 optimized algorithms. These algorithms can be used for:
- objects detection 
- face detection 
- classification of human actions in videos
- combining images 
- tracking moving objects
- red eye removal from images 
- and the list goes on....

In this repository, I have practiced using OpenCV commands to show how it works.

Details about OpenCV can be found [here](https://opencv.org/about).

I would strongly recommend going through another relevant topic ["Image Histogram"](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/d1b/tutorial_histogram_equalization.html), which is basically the intensity distribution of an image and it gives a basic idea of the number of pixels vs intensity. 

Thanks and enjoy :)

**Note:**
The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used here is Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

VS Code can be downloded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com).
