# OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) 
OpenCV is a machine learning library which comprises more than 2500 optimised algorithms. These algorithms can be used for:
- objects detection 
- face detection 
- classification of human actions in videos
- combining images 
- tracking moving objects
- red eye removel from images 
- and the list goes on...

In this repository I have practised using OpenCV commands to show how it works.

Details about OpenCV can be read from [here](https://opencv.org/about).

I would strongly recommend to go through another relevant topic ["Image Histogram"](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/d1b/tutorial_histogram_equalization.html), which is basically the intensity distribution of an image and it gives a basic idea of number of pixels vs intensity.. 

Thanks and enjoy :)
